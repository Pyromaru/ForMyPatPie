          <h2>Chapter 1 Once Upon a Swipe</h2>
          <p>Once upon a time, in a world full of strangers and fleeting faces, I stumbled upon someone who seemed unreal. She appeared on my screen like a star falling out of the sky , beautiful, radiant, and so far out of my league that I almost laughed at the thought of her ever noticing me.</p>
          <p>When she complimented me, I didnâ€™t even believe it. I thought she must be teasing, because how could someone so breathtakingly beautiful see something in me? But she wasnâ€™t jokingâ€¦ she was real. And from that simple moment, a spark was born.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 2 â€” The First Magic</h2>
          <p>Her beauty was undeniable , her hair that could captivate me, her lips I could imagine smiling, her eyes that carried galaxies. But what truly made me fall was her heart. Her honesty, her openness, her way of speaking without masks or games.</p>
          <p>I still remember the first time I made a nervous, stupid joke, and instead of ignoring it, she laughed louder than I ever expected , that â€˜HAHAHAHAHAHâ€™ still echoes in my heart. And then she called me cute. That was the first time I realized: maybe, just maybe, I wasnâ€™t invisible to her. Maybe my weirdness had finally found its match.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 3 â€” The Little Things</h2>
          <p>Love isnâ€™t always built from grand gestures. Sometimes, itâ€™s the little things that mean the most.Itâ€™s when she calls me baby, honey, love. Itâ€™s when she tells me what sheâ€™s doing, sharing parts of her day with me, even when she doesnâ€™t usually talk a lot. Itâ€™s the effort she makes, the way she shows me that I matter, even in silence.</p>
          <p>Every nickname, every update, every tiny piece of herself she gives me is worth more than all the treasures in the world. And those small thingsâ€¦ they stay with me, they keep me warm when I miss her the most.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 4 â€” Miles Between Us, Hearts Together</h2>
          <p>Yes, we are far apart. We donâ€™t walk the same streets, we donâ€™t sit under the same sky every day. Our love has been written in texts and words carried across invisible lines. But even in distance, she feels close , closer than anyone has ever been.</p>
          <p>Each message from her is like a heartbeat, reminding me I am not alone. When I whisper te quiero, mi amor, I imagine the words traveling to her, wrapping around her like a hug. We may not have held hands yet, but in my heart, Iâ€™m holding her every second.</p>

<article class="page page-5" data-chapter="5">
  <h2>Chapter 5 â€” Why Sheâ€™s My Everything</h2>
  <p>She is beautiful, yes , more beautiful than I could ever capture with words. But she is also strong. Strong in ways that inspire me, strong in ways that make me admire her endlessly. She is mature, caring, funny, and honest.</p>
  <p>She makes me feel safe. She makes me feel wanted. She makes me feel like maybe I am worth something after all.</p>
  <p>Her hair, her lips, her eyes , they take my breath away. But itâ€™s her heart, her mind, her soul that I am truly in love with. With her, I donâ€™t just feel like Iâ€™m living. I feel like Iâ€™m alive."</p>

      I donâ€™t know what the future will bring. I donâ€™t know where life will take us. But I do know one thing with absolute certainty: I want you in my story. I want you in my forever.
So here, with all the love I have in me, I ask you:
